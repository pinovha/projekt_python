# Learn From Scripts in python

ðŸš§ Work in Progress (WIP) ðŸš§
ðŸš§ Application is currently under development. ðŸš§

## The task of this program is to load a script from a movie/TV show episode provided by the user. The program will split the text into words, search for infinitives of all verbs, and find the base form of nouns. It will then store these words in a database. The user can display a list of words along with their Polish translations, mark words as known/unknown, and also randomly pick one word.
